## Flying Etiquette Survey – Seat Reclining Behavior

I chose the question **"Do you ever recline your seat when you fly?"** because it’s a common in-flight behavior that many passengers have strong feelings about. I wanted to see if the data reflected how socially acceptable this action is.

What I found interesting is how evenly split the responses were—many people say they recline only occasionally, while others never do. This shows how unsure people are about this part of flying etiquette.

My chart visualizes the frequency of each response using a bar chart. It shows that "Once in a while" was the most common answer, while fewer people said they "Always" or "Never" recline. This highlights the gray area in people's comfort with reclining.
